# hats-ci

The *hats-ci* installer installs packages needed to run browsers automated functional test on Windows.
Simplifies the steps to setup test environment in Windows. 

It consists of a series of PowerShell scripts which downloads and installs relevant dependencies and packages.
A virtual environment will be set up and configured in your local machine as well which will be ready for Robot Framework testing.


## Motivation
We believe that agile quality practices accelerate the delivery of quality applications.
To deal with a growing test backlog, test automation is a more scalable and cost-effective approach.

As a group of passionate quality engineers, we want to lower the barrier of entry to web app test automation so that everyone can contribute to software quality.
