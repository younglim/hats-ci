# hats-ci

The *hats-ci* installer installs packages needed to run browsers automated functional test on Windows.
Simplifies the steps to setup test environment in Windows. 

It consists of a series of PowerShell scripts which downloads and installs relevant dependencies and packages.
A virtual environment will be set up and configured in your local machine as well which will be ready for Robot Framework testing.


## Motivation
We believe that agile quality practices accelerate the delivery of quality applications.
To deal with a growing test backlog, test automation is a more scalable and cost-effective approach.

As a group of passionate quality engineers, we want to lower the barrier of entry to web app test automation so that everyone can contribute to software quality.

## Automated Tests
A quick way to create a test script is to use [Robotcorder](http://bit.ly/hats-robotcorder) and edit the script from Robotcorder.

### Get started with Robotcorder
1. Open a command prompt. Run `hats_shell`. 
2. Run `robotcorder` for instructions setting up the Chrome extension.

### Writing/Editing a test
You can either use
1. [Eclipse IDE](https://eclipse.org/) with [RED plugin](https://github.com/nokia/RED). Type `red` in hats_shell to begin.
2. [Pycharm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) with [IntelliBot plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7386-intellibot)
3. [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)

### Running a test
1. Open a command prompt. Run `hats_shell`.
2. Run the sample test script
```
cd "C:\Program Files\hats"
pybot testpage\test.robot
```

### Testing with Android
1. Make sure all $ANDROID environment variables are set.
2. To programatically boot the Android Virtual Device(AVD), the commmand `emulator -avd testAVD` must be run from the *tools* folder in the *android-sdk* directory.
